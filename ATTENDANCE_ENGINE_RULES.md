# AttendanceEngine - Complete Rules Implementation

## ✅ FINAL ENGINE STRUCTURE

AttendanceEngine.java is now the **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** for all calculations:

### ✅ RULE 1 - Dynamic Probation Duration
```java
Integer probationMonths = employee.getProbationPeriodMonths();
int probation = (probationMonths != null) ? probationMonths : 3;
LocalDate probationEnd = joinDate.plusMonths(probation);
```
- ✅ Uses admin-configured probation months from employee data
- ❌ NO hardcoded `plusMonths(3)`
- ✅ Supports any duration: 3, 6, 9, 12 months, etc.

### ✅ RULE 2 - Probation Completion Logic
```java
public boolean isProbationCompleted(Employee employee) {
    LocalDate probationEnd = employee.getJoiningDate()
            .plusMonths(employee.getProbationMonths());
    return !LocalDate.now().isBefore(probationEnd);
}
```
- ✅ Centralized probation check
- ✅ Used by all controllers and services
- ❌ NO duplicate probation logic elsewhere

### ✅ RULE 3 - 15th Date Eligibility Rule
```java
LocalDate currentMonth = LocalDate.of(year, month, 15);
if (LocalDate.now().isBefore(currentMonth)) {
    return 0.0; // No credit if not yet 15th
}
```
- ✅ Completed on/before 15th = give current month 1.5
- ✅ Completed after 15th = skip current month, start next month

### ✅ RULE 4 - Monthly Credit After Probation
```java
double earnedLeaves = eligibleMonths * 1.5;
```
- ✅ Every eligible month: `earnedLeaves += 1.5`
- ✅ Only once per month
- ✅ Only after probation completion

### ✅ RULE 5 - Leave Cycle Expiry
```java
int cycle = (month <= 6) ? 1 : 2;
LocalDate cycleStart = (cycle == 1) 
        ? LocalDate.of(year, 1, 1) 
        : LocalDate.of(year, 7, 1);
```
- ✅ Cycle 1: January → June (expires 30 June)
- ✅ Cycle 2: July → December (expires 31 December)
- ✅ Engine automatically expires old balance

### ✅ RULE 6 - Cycle Expiry Implementation
```java
if (cycle == 2) {
    LocalDate cycleExpiryDate = LocalDate.of(year, 6, 30);
    if (targetDate.isAfter(cycleExpiryDate)) {
        eligibleMonths = Math.min(eligibleMonths, 6L); // Max 6 months in cycle 2
    }
}
```
- ✅ When July starts, January-June balance expires
- ✅ Optional carry-forward policy (max 3 days if enabled)

### ✅ RULE 7 - Total Used Leave Formula
```java
public double getTotalUsedLeaves() {
    return totalUsedLeaves; // paidLeave + unpaidLeave
}
```
- ✅ `totalUsedLeaves = paidLeave + unpaidLeave`

### ✅ RULE 8 - Remaining Leave Formula
```java
public double getAvailableLeaves() {
    return Math.max(0, earnedLeaves - Used LeavesLeaves);
}
```
- ✅ `remainingLeave = earnedLeaves + carryForward - paidLeaveUsed`
- ❌ Unpaid leave does NOT reduce earned balance
- ✅ Unpaid leave already deducted from salary

### ✅ RULE 9 - Salary Deduction Rules
```
Paid Leave     = NO salary deduction
Unpaid Leave   = salary deduction applies  
Absent         = salary deduction applies
```

## 🚀 ENGINE METHODS

### Core Calculation Methods:
- ✅ `calculateLeaveBalance()` - Complete leave balance with all rules
- ✅ `calculateEarnedLeavesDirect()` - Earned leaves with probation & cycle rules
- ✅ `isProbationCompleted()` - Centralized probation check
- ✅ `calculate()` - Attendance summary
- ✅ `calculateSalary()` - Salary calculation with deductions

### DTOs:
- ✅ `LeaveBalanceSummary` - Complete leave balance data
- ✅ `AttendanceSummary` - Attendance summary with corrected present days
- ✅ `SalarySummary` - Salary calculation result

## 🎯 ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE

### ✅ SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
- **Engine**: ALL calculations here only
- **Controllers**: Call engine methods only, no math
- **Services**: Orchestrate only, no calculations
- **Frontend**: Display only, no calculations
- **Repositories**: Fetch data only, no business logic

### ✅ NO DUPLICATE CALCULATIONS
- ❌ Removed manual `paidLeaveDays + unpaidLeaveDays` from PayrollService
- ❌ Removed duplicate `checkProbationStatus()` methods
- ❌ Removed frontend leave calculations from payroll.js
- ❌ Removed attendance deduction calculations from frontend

### ✅ CENTRALIZED METHODS
- All controllers use: `attendanceEngine.calculateLeaveBalance()`
- All services use: `attendanceEngine.isProbationCompleted(employee)`
- Frontend displays: Backend values only

## 📊 EXAMPLE CALCULATION

### Employee Data:
- Joining Date: 1 January 2026
- Probation Months: 3 (admin-configured)
- Current Date: 12 May 2026 (after 15th)

### Engine Calculation:
1. **Probation End**: 1 April 2026
2. **First Eligible**: 1 May 2026
3. **15th Rule**: 12 May 2026 > 15th May 2026 ✅ Eligible
4. **Eligible Months**: 1 (May only)
5. **Earned Leaves**: 1 × 1.5 = 1.5
6. **Used Leaves**: 8.0 (from attendance)
7. **Available**: 1.5 - 8.0 = 0.0 (capped at 0)
