# HRMS System - Project Documentation

## Project Overview
This is a Human Resource Management System (HRMS) built with Spring Boot that manages employee attendance, leave, payroll, and payslip generation. The system supports half-day leave, pending attendance resolution, audit logging, payroll locking, and attendance finalization.

---

## Payslip Calculation

### Salary Components
- **Basic Salary**: Base salary of the employee
- **HRA (House Rent Allowance)**: Housing allowance
- **DA (Dearness Allowance)**: Cost of living adjustment
- **Other Allowances**: Additional allowances
- **Gross Salary**: Basic + HRA + DA + Other Allowances

### Deductions
- **PF (Provident Fund)**: 12% of basic salary (or custom value)
- **ESI**: Employee State Insurance (currently set to 0)
- **Income Tax**: Calculated based on basic salary
- **Insurance**: Percentage of basic salary (if configured)
- **Absent/Leave Deduction**: Calculated based on attendance

### Deduction Formula
```
Deduction = (absent_days × daily_salary) + (unpaid_leave_days × daily_salary)
```

Where:
- `daily_salary = basic_salary / 26` (based on 26 working days per month)
- `absent_days` includes actual absent days + half-day contribution (0.5 per half-day)
- `unpaid_leave_days` includes unpaid approved leaves + half-day contribution (0.5 per half-day)

### Net Salary Calculation
```
Net Salary = Gross Salary - (PF + ESI + Income Tax + Insurance + Absent/Leave Deduction)
```

### Probation vs Post-Probation
- **During Probation**: All leaves are considered unpaid
- **Post-Probation**: Paid leaves are deducted from leave balance first, then unpaid leaves trigger deductions

### Payroll Lock
- When payroll is locked for a month/year, attendance changes do NOT trigger payslip regeneration
- Admin can lock/unlock payroll via API endpoints
- Lock prevents accidental salary changes after payroll processing

### Salary Adjustment System
- When payroll is locked, attendance changes cannot affect salary directly
- Instead, admin can create salary adjustments to compensate for corrections
- Adjustments are only allowed when payroll is locked
- Adjustment types: BONUS, DEDUCTION, CORRECTION, OVERTIME, OTHER
- Adjustments can be positive (addition) or negative (deduction)
- Adjustments must be marked as "applied" after being processed
- Unapplied adjustments can be deleted; applied adjustments cannot
- This provides a controlled way to fix payroll errors after lock

## Leave Rules

### Leave Types
- **Full-Day Leave**: Entire day off
- **Half-Day Leave**: First half or second half of the day off
- **Paid Leave**: Deducted from leave balance, no salary deduction
- **Unpaid Leave**: Not deducted from balance, triggers salary deduction

### Leave Balance
- Employees have leave balance per leave type (e.g., Sick Leave, Casual Leave, Earned Leave)
- Leave balance is tracked and updated when leaves are approved
- During probation, all leaves are unpaid regardless of balance

### Leave Cycle Expiry
- Leave balance is tracked in two cycles per year:
  - **Cycle 1**: January - June
  - **Cycle 2**: July - December
- At the end of each cycle, unUsed Leaves leaves are handled as follows:
  - **Carry Forward Limit**: Maximum 10 leaves can be carried forward to next cycle
  - **Expired Leaves**: Any leaves beyond the carry-forward limit expire
- When Cycle 2 is created, unUsed Leaves leaves from Cycle 1 are carried forward (up to 10)
- Expired leaves are recorded for audit purposes
- This ensures leave balance doesn't accumulate indefinitely

### Leave Approval Process
1. Employee submits leave request with dates and type
2. Admin reviews and approves/rejects
3. Approved leaves update attendance records
4. Leave balance is adjusted accordingly

### Half-Day Leave Implementation
- Employees can select "Half Day" checkbox when requesting leave
- For half-day leave, employee must specify: `FIRST_HALF` or `SECOND_HALF`
- Half-day leaves contribute 0.5 to leave balance deduction
- Half-day leaves contribute 0.5 to salary deduction calculation
- **STRICT RULE**: When half-day leave is approved, the entire day is marked as PENDING
- Admin must resolve whether the employee worked the remaining half (PRESENT or ABSENT)
- DO NOT auto-mark as HALF_DAY or LEAVE - always PENDING for admin resolution

### Validation Rules
- **Cannot mark FULL PRESENT** on a day with approved full-day leave
- This prevents double-counting (present + leave on same day)
- **Cannot apply half-day leave for both halves** of the same day
- If one half is already marked as leave, user must apply for full-day leave instead

## Attendance Management

### Attendance Statuses
- **PRESENT**: Employee attended full day
- **ABSENT**: Employee was absent
- **LATE**: Employee arrived late (after 9:00 AM)
- **HALF_DAY**: Employee attended half day
- **PENDING**: Attendance requires admin resolution
- **LEAVE**: Employee was on approved leave
- **NOT_MARKED**: Attendance not yet recorded

### PENDING Attendance System
- When attendance cannot be automatically determined, it's marked as PENDING
- Admin must manually resolve PENDING attendance as PRESENT or ABSENT
- PENDING attendance does NOT count as present until resolved
- PENDING status is displayed in yellow color in the UI

### Attendance Resolution
- Admin can resolve PENDING attendance via API endpoint:
  ```
  PUT /api/attendance/{attendanceId}/resolve-pending?newStatus=PRESENT|ABSENT&remarks=...
  ```
- Resolution triggers audit log entry
- Resolution triggers payslip regeneration (if payroll not locked)

### Attendance Finalization
- Admin can finalize attendance for a date range
- Finalized attendance cannot be modified
- Finalization prevents retroactive changes to historical attendance
- Can be unfinalized if corrections are needed

### Holiday System
- Admin can configure company holidays
- Holidays can be one-time or recurring (same date every year)
- On holidays, attendance is automatically skipped
- Holidays do not count as absent or present
- Holiday calendar can be managed via API
- Supports checking if a specific date is a holiday

## Half-Day Leave Logic

### Scenario: Employee takes half-day leave
1. Employee requests half-day leave with type (FIRST_HALF or SECOND_HALF)
2. Admin approves the leave
3. Attendance record shows status based on the other half:
   - If employee worked the other half → HALF_DAY status
   - If employee didn't work the other half → PENDING status (requires admin resolution)

### PENDING Status for Remaining Half
- When an employee takes half-day leave, the remaining half of the day is marked PENDING
- Admin must resolve whether the employee worked the remaining half:
  - Mark as PRESENT if they worked
  - Mark as ABSENT if they didn't work
- This ensures accurate attendance tracking and salary calculation

### Salary Impact
- Half-day leave contributes 0.5 to unpaid leave deduction
- If remaining half is marked ABSENT → additional 0.5 absent deduction
- Total deduction for full day absent with half-day leave: 1.0 × daily_salary

## Audit Logging

### What is Logged
- All attendance status changes
- PENDING attendance resolutions
- Attendance finalization actions
- Payroll lock/unlock actions

### Audit Log Fields
- **Entity Type**: ATTENDANCE, LEAVE, PAYROLL, etc.
- **Entity ID**: ID of the affected record
- **Action**: CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, RESOLVE_PENDING, etc.

## Key Business Rules

1. **No Auto-Present**: PENDING attendance never auto-converts to PRESENT. Admin must resolve.
2. **No Double-Counting**: Cannot mark PRESENT on a day with approved full-day leave.
3. **Payroll Lock Protection**: Locked payroll prevents attendance changes from affecting salary.
4. **Attendance Finalization**: Finalized attendance cannot be modified without unfinalizing.
5. **Audit Trail**: All critical changes are logged for accountability.
6. **Probation Rules**: All leaves are unpaid during probation period.
7. **Half-Day Handling**: Half-day leaves always mark the entire day as PENDING for admin resolution.
8. **Leave Cycle Expiry**: UnUsed Leaves leaves expire at cycle end (max 10 carried forward).
9. **Salary Adjustments**: Post-lock corrections must use adjustment system, not direct attendance changes.
10. **Holiday Handling**: Holidays skip attendance automatically, no present/absent marking.
11. **Both Halves Validation**: Cannot apply half-day leave for both halves of same day (use full-day leave).
